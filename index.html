            This world-famous athlete and actor was born in Thal, Austria in 1947, and by the age of 20 was dominating
            the
            sport of competitive bodybuilding, becoming the youngest person ever to win the Mr. Universe title. By
            generating a new international audience for bodybuilding, Schwarzenegger turned himself into a sports icon.
            With his sights set on Hollywood, he emigrated to America in 1968, and went on to win five Mr. Universe
            titles
            and seven Mr. Olympia titles before retiring to dedicate himself to acting. Later, he would go on to earn a
            college degree from the University of Wisconsin and proudly became a U.S. citizen.

            Schwarzenegger, who worked under the pseudonym Arnold Strong in his first feature, HERCULES in New York,
            quickly made a name for himself in Hollywood. In 1977, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association recognized
            him
            with a Golden Globe® for New Male Star of the Year for his role in STAY HUNGRY opposite Sally Field.<br> His
            big
            break came in 1982 when the sword and sorcery epic, CONAN THE BARBARIAN, hit box office gold. In 1984,
            Schwarzenegger blew up the screen and catapulted himself into cinema history as the title character in James
            Cameron’s sci-fi thriller, TERMINATOR. He is the only actor to be in both categories of the American Film
            Institute’s Hundred Years of Heroes and Villains for roles he played in the film. To date his films have
            grossed over $3 billion worldwide.
